Comix [Come Here!] is an addon for World of Warcraft (WoW).

Adds sound for "[Death Grip]":http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49576 to "Comix":http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/comix-the-return.aspx.

Usage: use the "[Death Grip]":http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49576 ability

Note that "Comix":http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/comix-the-return.aspx is an optional dependency for this addon. It is designed to use "Comix":http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/comix-the-return.aspx settings if present, but will function without it installed.
